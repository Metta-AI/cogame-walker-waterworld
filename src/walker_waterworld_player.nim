## The walker-waterworld player container: a policy is just a prompt.
##
## This process is DELIBERATELY thin. It connects to its seat, sends ONE Sprite
## v1 chat message carrying its registration, and then only receives. Every
## decision happens inside the GAME server, because that is the only container
## the platform injects the `anthropic_api_key` coworld secret into, and because
## keeping the control layer server-side is what makes the recorded command-byte
## log reproducible with no network in the loop.
##
##   PLAYER_PROMPT        a strategy in plain English -> this seat is an LLM seat
##   PLAYER_SCRIPTED      shoal | drifter             -> this seat is scripted
##   PLAYER_POLICY_LABEL  a free label for the replay's `register` record
##
## A seat that sets neither is `shoal`. To field your own policy, reuse this
## image and set PLAYER_PROMPT:
##
##   coworld upload-policy <image> --name my-waterworld \
##     --run /bin/walker-waterworld-player \
##     --secret-env PLAYER_PROMPT="<your strategy>"
